It can also be tweaked to focus on your academic achievements if you don&rsquo;t have much work experience yet.</li>\n<li><strong>The </strong><a href=\"https://resumelab.com/resume/functional\"><strong>functional resume format</strong></a><strong> is also known as the skills-based resume format.</strong> It focuses on your <a href=\"https://resumelab.com/resume/skills\">resume skill set</a> rather than your work history, so you may use it to gloss over <a href=\"https://resumelab.com/resume/employment-gaps\">employment gaps</a> and employment histories that aren&rsquo;t perfectly neat and linear. However, many recruiters aren&rsquo;t familiar with functional resumes and might reject them. Also, companies use Applicant Tracking Software to parse resumes, and functional resumes aren&rsquo;t ATS-friendly</li>\n<li><strong>The combination format gives equal attention to your skills and work experience.</strong> It can be useful in certain situations but has the same drawbacks as the functional resume format.</li>\n</ul>"
